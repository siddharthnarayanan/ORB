Webster encourages students to pursue their interests by working on large, collaborative, often multidisciplinary projects with real-world applications, including the creation of a 3D visualization for the new Center for the Arts at Virginia Tech.With help from two of his students (Chris Russell of Atlanta, Ga., a senior majoring in studio art, and Mallory Brangan of Norfolk, Va., a senior majoring in biochemistry and studio art) Dane Webster used models and single-frame renderings from architecture firms Snohetta and STV to create a virtual fly through of the center. Fly throughs are animated videos that allow users to virtually move through a structure, getting a close-up view of a building."

Our high-level behavioral model is able to produce appropriate animated behavior that includes synchronized body-orientation and gesture of individual actors within the simulation. Because the model operationalizes a well-founded social-linguistic Common Ground (CG) theory of human interaction, the behavior chains form meaningful interactions among the actors. The model includes micro-behaviors relating to CG theory, and macro-behavior relating to the animation context. This allows reuse of the micro-behaviors as animation contexts change and flexible adaptation to different animation contexts."

Most existing rendering techniques, especially level of detail (LOD) processing, have suffered from their sequential execution natures. We present a GPU-based approach which enables the interactive rendering of large 3D models with hundreds of millions of triangles. Our work contributes to the massive rendering research in two ways. First, we propose a GPU-based streaming approach which adopt a frame-to-frame coherence scheme in order to minimize the high communication cost between CPU and GPU. Second, we present a simple and effcient mesh simplification algorithm towards GPU architecture. Our results show that GPU-based streaming approach and the parallel mesh simplification algorithm significantly improve the overall rendering performance."

However, it is difficult to produce full body animation that looks realistic enough to be comparable to studio quality human motion data. The commercial motion capture systems are expensive and not suitable for capture in everyday environments. Real-time requirements tend to reduce quality of animation. We present a motion graph based framework to produce high quality motion sequences in real-time using a set of inertial sensor based controllers. The user's action generates signals from the controllers that provide constraints to select appropriate sequence of motions from a structured database of human motions, namely motion graph. Our local search algorithm utilizes noise prone and rapidly varying input sensor signals for querying a large database in real-time. The ability to waive the controllers for producing high quality animation provides a simple 3D user interface that is intuitive to use. The proposed framework is low cost and easy to setup."

We present a real-time crowd rendering system on GPUs with a special focus on how to preserve texture appearance in progressive LOD-based mesh simplification algorithms. Our results show that the proposed parallel LOD approach can get up to 5.33 times of speedup compared with the standard pseudo-instancing approach."

We address this issue using a machine learning approach that relies on a database of speech related high-fidelity facial motions. From this training set, we derive a generative model of expressive facial motion that incorporates emotion control while maintaining accurate lip-synching. The emotional content of the input speech can be manually specified by the user or automatically extracted from the audio signal using a Support Vector Machine classifier."

The layout and artifacts of the village are entirely based on archaeological data, illustrations, and journals from the period. The team of artists worked closely to insure accuracy of data and have included only those details that are found to be authentic to both the time period and the physical location. Users can navigate through the village and explore as if they were colonists or Native Americans to get a feel for what life was like in the time of early English settlement. Lesson Materials: Discovering the New World - This lesson has been developed to supplement other areas of the Virginia Studies Standards of Learning and, more specifically, the study of the Jamestown settlement. As students are led through an interactive, virtual Paspahegh Indian village, they are asked to consider ways these Native Americans can help lengthen the survival of the English settlers. The lesson involves exploration of the village, understanding how the natives make use of natural resources, and the role Captain John Smith played in the exploration of the New World. Students engage in activities using a variety of digital technology tools such as virtual simulation, Blogging, historical videos, graphing, and spreadsheets. Students demonstrate their ability to make careful observations, analyze the information, and communicate ideas with other students.
