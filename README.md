The Orb is an interactive platform for audio-visual representation of data designed to promote comprehension and identification of links and relationships among database entries. It utilizes Processing language to render an interactive 3D orb whose surface is populated with data points. Using an array of possible Human-Computer Interaction devices, including mouse and Leap Motion touchless interface, users can rotate and select points of interest which upon selection generate a lattice of relationships with other projects with their respective line thickness denoting the strength of such a relationship. The ensuing tech-o-system allows users to navigate the database landscape in a three-dimensional fashion, while concurrently providing relationship data in a visually accessible way. When selected, each project also provides an overlay with a summary and supporting media material (e.g. image or a video) with additional details on the project.
