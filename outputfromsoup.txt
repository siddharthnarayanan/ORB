NDSSL in the News Disease Science Investigators: DC is featured in the March issue of Roanoke Business Magazine. 

In DSI-DC, players act as a public health agent asked to solve a growing crisis resulting from an infectious disease outbreak. The educational adventure game focuses on the science and mathematics of infectious diseases, the application of
computational modeling for decision-making, and the civic and health implications of these actions.

About Us 
The Network Dynamics and Simulation Science Laboratory is pursuing an advanced research and development program for interaction-based modeling, simulation, and associated analysis, experimental design, and decision support tools for understanding large biological, information, social, and technological systems. Extremely detailed, multi-scale computer simulations allow formal and experimental investigation of these systems. The need for such simulations is derived from questions posed by scientists, policy makers, and planners involved with very large complex systems. The simulation applications ...

Simfrastructure CINET (Cyber-infrastructure for network science) is a middleware in development that provides network scientists with a self-sustainable and expandable computational and analytic environment for research, education, and training.

CINET manages a broad array of simulation models, datasets, and digital libraries while providing a standardized, inter-operable user interface.  Since it hides the details of computation and data management, learning effort is minimal.  However, it is flexible enough to allow for integration of off-the-shelf network analysis suites and ...

Transportation When capturing socio-technical systems, it is often essential to capture who visit what locations at what times. This allows one to deduce the detailed contact patterns of individuals which in turn allows one to model and capture a broad range of contagion processes. An epidemic process is one such example. Such a model also allows one to derive information about how devices such as cell phones move. In contrast to for example random waypoint models, ...
